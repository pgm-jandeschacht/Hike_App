Our friends at AfterShokz and BibRave have teamed up to help us all stay injury-free.

In this article, Don Reichelt from BibRave shares his story of how he returned to competitive ultra running post-injury.

On December 8th, 2018, Dan entered a trail race with full expectations to win. During a hard downhill section, with about nine miles left, he stepped oddly on a rock, and his right ankle rolled over the top resulting in an audible “pop” and immediate pain. He had no doubt in his mind that he had either broken something or ruptured something. It wasn’t good. He was stubborn enough to finish the race, but X-rays later confirmed multiple breaks. 

Dan's road to recovery began immediately, and with some diligent rehab, he finished 4th in his “come back” 50-mile race less than six months post-injury. During Dan's recovery, he learned a ton of tips that he's taking with him to prevent future injury.
